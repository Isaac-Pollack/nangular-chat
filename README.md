# Nangular Chat
This project repo is split into two folders;

'Chat' - The frontend aspect

'Server' - Server side aspect

## ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

To begin local development/installation you will need to run the following:
```console
cd nangular-chat/chat
npm install
```
And also
```console
cd nangular-chat/server
npm install
```

## Running Locally
CORS middleware is installed to make this seamless, so make sure to have run the above steps before hand. As this is split into two folders, you will need to run both the server side and the Angular application for full functionality. This can be achieved by running the following:
### Server
```console
cd nangular-chat/server
node server.js
```
And all server actions will take place over [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

### Frontend
```console
cd nangular-chat/server
ng serve
```
Allowing the frontend to be accessed via [localhost:4200](localhost:4200)

## Version Control
This project utilises Git and is hosted on Github, as these provide flexible and free version control across multiple devices which is a big positive for me, moving between. I am able to go at my own pace with development and merge as I see fit, with the option of collaboration later down the line with little to no change. I mainly use the repo solely for backup purposes as my local copies contain any changes, but committing often is something I strive to do.

## Data Structures
s
## Architecture
### Components
<b>Login: </b>This page <br>
<b>Register: </b>This page <br>
<b>Profile: </b>This page <br>
<b>Admin: </b>This page
### Services
<b>Storage: </b>This service <br>
### Routes
'/' - The landing page, just aesthetic, with nav.
'/login - Log in page
'/profile - Greeting profile page, retrieves current session storage and displays username, email and admin priveledges (group assignments)
'/admin - Those with admin accesss are given the ability to create new users, groups and channels in mongoDB.
'**' - 404, page not found. This is our catch, and it redirects us back to the home page.

### Node / Server
{{THIS IS UNTRUE FOR PART 1, SIMPLY LOCAL STORAGE}}
- The Node.js server storage utilizes a MongoDB database. The mongo database stores all of the user, group, and channel data as well as chat history.

### REST API
| Route  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [/](http://localhost:3000/api) | Displays the repo's README.md file rendered as HTML using [Marked.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked). |
| [/api/users](http://localhost:3000/api/users) | Displays all the users within the users.json file. // Converted to MongoDB in Pt2 // |
| [/api/login](http://localhost:3000/api/login) | Tests validity of the input email + password from our login component against our JSON file, returning a True/False boolean for use in our login component. |
[/api/EXAMPLE](http://localhost:3000/api/EXAMPLE) | MORE ROUTES TO COME |
## Application Interactions
â€¢ Describe the details of the interaction between client and server by indicating how the files and global vars in server side will be changed and how the display of each angular component page will be updated.

A description of how you divided the responsibilities between client and server (you are encouraged to have the server provide a REST API which returns JSON in addition to a static directory)

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
